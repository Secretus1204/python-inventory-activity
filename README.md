A list to store item names
A dictionary to store the corresponding item prices
The program should allow the user to:

Add a new item
Ask for the item name
Ask for the price
Add it to both the list and the dictionary
Prevent duplicate item names
Update the price of an existing item
Ask for the item name
If it exists, update its price
